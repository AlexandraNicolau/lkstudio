                    <h2>Luba Kozharskaia</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. This is a city with great history and a world-famous
                        culture. When I was 10-years-old, I decided to be a professional ballet dancer. From that year
                        my ballet journey began. Eight years in the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet brought me to the
                        famous Mariinsky theatre in 2005. I was happy to be a part of this company as it is the biggest
                        ballet and opera theatre in Russia and Europe with amazing opportunities. I performed a
                        wonderful and varying repertoire, worked with ballet celebrities such as Uliana Lopatkina, Diana
                        Vishneva, Danila Korsuntsev, David Hallberg (American Ballet Theatre) and many other
                        world-famous performers.</p>
                    <p>For about twelve years in this ballet company I have tried to absorb everything from ballet and
                        related areas (history, styles, music, experience of people who were around me) and tried to
                        apply it in my work.</p>
                    <p>In 2017 I have decided to finish my ballet career. I have realised that during the past 20 years
                        of hard work and education I have gained unique experience in many aspects of fitness,
                        choreography, injury management and rehabilitation. That is why I started studying in the
                        Fitness College in Saint-Petersburg and became a Personal Trainer.</p>
                    <p>Through my education I recognised that I have valuable experience and knowledge to help people
                        prevent different injuries and improve their overall well-being. I have moved to the United
                        Kingdom in 2017 and since then I have been sharing my expertise and enthusiasm working as a
                        ballet teacher, personal trainer and group class instructor. My work focuses on classical ballet
                        choreography, personal well being, rehabilitation and pain management.
